        We had a two week time period as budding developers to put our imaginations to work and see what would come of it, 
        and I would say the biggest challenge was getting the local storage working correctly. I played a leading role in the development process,
        handling the direction and work flow of the project.

        having to sift through code to learn how the application was supposed to work was a good challenge.`
